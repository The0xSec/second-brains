## Overview: DevSecOps

DevSecOps, a combination of "Development", "Security", and "Operations", is a philosophy that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. It aims to bridge traditionally siloed teams (Development and Operations) and embed security into every component of the development lifecycle. The goal is to create a 'security as code' culture where business-critical applications can be deployed without compromising security.

**Details: The Depth of DevSecOps**

The DevSecOps model promotes a shift-left approach in security, pushing it earlier into the system development cycle rather than leaving it as an afterthought. This approach includes automating security controls, and integrating security checks into the CI/CD pipeline. By doing this, potential vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed rapidly, preventing delays in the software release process. This ensures continuous security along with continuous integration and continuous delivery, minimizing the risk of security issues in production environments and the impact on project timelines and costs.

**Common Tools**

A variety of tools can fit into a DevSecOps environment. 'Static application security testing' (SAST) tools such as SonarQube are used to analyze source code for potential vulnerabilities. 'Dynamic application security testing' (DAST) tools like OWASP ZAP can detect issues in a running application. For container security, tools like Docker Bench for Security and Falco are often used. Infrastructure as code security can be ensured by using tools like Chef InSpec and Terraform. Moreover, secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault help maintain data integrity.

**Who Should Look into This Path**

DevSecOps is a promising path for software developers, system administrators, IT security professionals, and individuals in similar roles who wish to bridge the gap between rapid code deployment and secure coding practices. Additionally, anyone involved in the software development lifecycle - including project managers, quality assurance, and business analysts - would gain significant value from understanding the principles of DevSecOps. Ultimately, DevSecOps goes beyond roles; it is an organization-wide culture that everyone must engage in for optimal security and efficiency.
