## Overview

Application Security is a branch of cybersecurity that focuses on protecting applications from threats and vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or thwarted services. As applications are the key point of entry for hackers, the role of application security is to ensure security is integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to minimize these vulnerabilities.

## Details

Application security involves several critical aspects. It includes coding securely, performing regular security assessments, running automated scans for vulnerabilities, and penetration testing. Application security engineers work closely with developers to educate them about secure coding practices, run security tests, and fix any potential vulnerabilities found in applications. They also incorporate security into the SDLC, ensuring security controls are a part of the design, development, testing, and deployment processes.

## Common Tools

A range of tools helps application security engineers in their work. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, like SonarQube, are used to analyze the source code of applications for vulnerabilities. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools, like OWASP ZAP, test running applications for potential risks. Furthermore, Software Composition Analysis tools are used to detect vulnerable open source components. Additionally, web application firewalls (WAFs) and runtime application self-protection (RASP) tools offer real-time protection for applications.

## Who Should Look Into This Path

Individuals considering a career in Application Security should have an interest in software development, cybersecurity, and problem-solving. Those who enjoy thinking like an attacker to better defend against them would thrive in this field. It's ideal if you have a background in computer science or related areas, along with a strong understanding of coding and web technologies. Skills in programming languages, knowledge about security frameworks and standards (like OWASP), and a firm understanding of the existing threat landscape are beneficial for those eyeing this path.
