## Overview

A Threat Intelligence Analyst is a cybersecurity professional who collects and analyzes information about emerging threats, threat actors, and attack methods. The primary goal is to help organizations understand the risks of the most common and severe external threats, provide timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence, and make informed decisions on protecting their digital assets.

## Details

Threat Intelligence Analysts systematically gather data from various sources, such as open web, dark web, internal data, and feeds from cybersecurity firms. They analyze this data to identify new threats, track emerging trends, uncover advanced persistent threats, and understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors. Their role is vital in proactive security measures and guiding incident response. They not only share the intelligence internally but may also collaborate with external organizations to disseminate threat intelligence.

## Common Tools

Threat Intelligence Analysts utilize a variety of tools, platforms, and databases to gather threat data. These range from open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to paid threat intelligence platforms like Recorded Future, ThreatConnect, or FireEye iSIGHT. Analysts also use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand threat actor TTPs and apply Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) for standardized threat information sharing.

## Who Should Look Into This Path

A career as a Threat Intelligence Analyst can be exciting for those with a keen interest in proactive cybersecurity and global cyber threat landscapes. It is suitable for individuals with a background in IT, computer science, or a security-related discipline and a thorough understanding of networking, operating systems, malware, and modern threat trends. Strong analytical skills, keen attention to detail, ability to think like an attacker, excellent communication skills, and the willingness to stay updated with evolving technology and threat environments are crucial for this role.
