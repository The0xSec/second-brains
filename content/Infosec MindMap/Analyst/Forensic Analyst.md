## Overview

A Forensic Analyst, also known as a Computer Forensic Analyst or Cyber Forensic Analyst, is a professional who collects, identifies, and investigates digital evidence in cybersecurity incidents. They delve into cyber attacks, data breaches, or any form of security incidents to understand how and why they occurred, with a focus on tracking the origin of the incident and identifying the perpetrators.

## Details

Forensic Analysts utilize specialized tools and techniques to analyze incident landscapes, conduct post-incident investigations, and extract data for further analysis. They work on digital devices and networks to look for clues and data artifacts left by cybercriminals. This process involves analyzing systems to discover how an intrusion was accomplished and retrieving lost or damaged data. They also aid in various aspects, including litigation support, internal investigations, and regulatory compliance. Analysts often write-up findings, prepare detailed reports, and, if necessary, provide expert testimony in court cases.

## Common Tools

Forensic Analysts use a host of advanced technical tools to mine for digital evidence. Disk and data capture tools like EnCase or FTK (Forensic Toolkit) and network forensics tools like Wireshark are commonly used. Other resources involve file viewers, registry analysis tools, and bespoke database querying software. They may also leverage scripting languages like Python to automate tasks and sift through large datasets for relevant information.

## Who Should Look Into This Path

Forensic Analyst careers suit those fascinated by investigative work and problem-solving within the realm of cybersecurity. It's suitable for individuals who have backgrounds in computer science, IT, cybersecurity, or criminal justice. Strong technical skills, specifically knowledge around operating systems, networks, databases, and programming languages, are essential. Excellent attention to detail, logical thinking, and good written and verbal communication skills are beneficial. Those ready for continuous learning to adapt to evolving cyber threats and forensic technologies would excel in this role.
