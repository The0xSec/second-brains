# Manifesto
Hey all, my name is 0x, I am a Father, Husband and Lead Cloud Security Engineer. I have a passion for automation, immutable infrastructure development patterns, multi-cloud, distributed systems and artificial Intelligence. I am in the middle of writing a book for folks wanting a no frills approach to learning both Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and Amazon Web Services, which you can find my [[../Terraforming the CCP - A Changelog Diary|changelog]]

In my current role, I am leading a small team of infrastructure security engineers focused on building self service platforms for internal teams for actions such as cloud account provisioning using a JIT (Just-In-Time) philosophy. Essentially, bringing the threshold of getting a new cloud account down to as close to 0 time as possible with pre-built information security controls by default. I have a list of some of my favorite security and tech [Helpful Blogs](../helpful-links/Helpful%20Blogs.md) and [Helpful Podcasts](../helpful-links/Helpful%20Podcasts.md) at the given links as well. I also have a mindmap for various information security specialties located at the[Infosec MindMap](../Infosec%20MindMap/Infosec%20MindMap.md)

As you navigate this evolving forest of ideas, know that this corner of the internet is a representation of my internal thoughts, and is bound to be incomplete by the time I leave this earth. Regardless of when that time is, I hope for this to a true reflection of who I was and who I evolved into when the light has come for me. 

I am motivation for self improvement is driven by two factors, singular forces both internal and external. The first, my family. My two kids and my lovely wife are the reasons why I do what I do today. More so, they have shaped who I am today, and who I will be tomorrow. The reason you are reading this is because of them.

Additionally, my internal curiosity is what I believe has been the ultimate driver for me. It is a powerful attribute which drives me towards a journey of self discovery and intellectual exploration. This is the wick that lights my path, a guide that drives me to new ideas to explore and expand upon. 

As William Arthur Ward said “Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning”. 

This is my manifesto. Forever long shall it live. 
Thank you, 0x.
